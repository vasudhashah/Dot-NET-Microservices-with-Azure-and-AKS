# eCommerce Microservices Project

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the development of a robust and scalable **eCommerce platform** built using cutting-edge technologies like **ASP.NET Core Web API** with a focus on **microservices architecture**.

---

## **What Will You Learn?**

- **Complete eCommerce Project**  
  Develop a fully functional eCommerce platform featuring **users**, **products**, and **orders microservices**. Learn to implement and integrate these components.

- **Microservices Architecture**  
  Master microservices design with diverse databases like **Postgres**, **MySQL**, and **MongoDB**, implementing modern architectural patterns.

- **Containerization & Orchestration**  
  Use **Docker** and **Kubernetes** to containerize applications and orchestrate them with **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** for **zero downtime deployments**.

- **Fault Tolerance & Caching**  
  Implement advanced fault tolerance strategies using **Polly**, utilize **Redis** for caching, and ensure reliable messaging with **RabbitMQ**.

- **DevOps Integration**  
  Hands-on experience with **Azure DevOps**, including setting up **CI/CD pipelines**, managing environments, and integrating with **Azure Key Vault**.

- **API Management & Authentication**  
  Configure an **API Gateway** using **Ocelot**, manage APIs with **Azure API Management**, and secure your application with **Microsoft Entra ID B2C**.

## **What Will You Build?**

### **Key Features**

1. **Users Microservice**  
   Manage user data with a **clean architecture** and tools like **AutoMapper** and **FluentValidation**.

2. **Products Microservice**  
   Handle product information via **minimal APIs** with integrated **MySQL** and **EF Core**.

3. **Orders Microservice**  
   Process orders using **MongoDB**, **minimal APIs**, and focus on **fault tolerance** and **resilience**.

4. **Frontend Integration**  
   Seamlessly connect your microservices with a pre-built **Angular frontend** for a complete end-to-end solution.
